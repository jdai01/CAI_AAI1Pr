# Algorithms for AI 1 Practical

## Overview

This course introduces the fundamentals of statistics-based artificial intelligence and machine learning, focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning. 

Key concepts such as data preprocessing, regression, classification, gradient descent, evaluation, and validation of models will be learnt.
Topics include logic, fuzzy logic, loss functions, and common frameworks/tools for modern machine learning.
